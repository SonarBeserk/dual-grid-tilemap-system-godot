# ‚ú®üëØ Dual-grid tilemap system in Godot üëØ‚ú®

This is a demo of how I implemented a simple dual-grid tilemap system in Godot 4.4.1 Mono using C#. Hope it helps!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: consider these other (possibly better) dual-grid implementations
If you are looking for a non-mono (GDScript) version, or a version that allows you to refresh tiles from the editor, here are some I recommend:
- Godot 4.2: [https://github.com/GlitchedinOrbit/dual-grid-tilemap-system-godot-gdscript](https://github.com/GlitchedinOrbit/dual-grid-tilemap-system-godot-gdscript)
- Godot 4.4: [https://github.com/pablogila/TileMapDual_godot_node](https://github.com/pablogila/TileMapDual_godot_node) <-- this one also supports isometric and hex tiles!

Otherwise, here's what mine looks like:

Long story short, it does NOT use terrain tiles but acts very similarly to them. It's just a [custom Node2D](./Scripts/DualGridTilemap.cs) that manages a "world" `TileMapLayer` and a "display" `TileMapLayer`! The logic to determine which tile to display is controlled by a set of 16 hard-coded rules.

The main reasons I love the dual-grid approach as opposed to regular terrain tiles/auto tiles 
is because:
- it allows the tiles to have perfectly rounded corners
- a maximum of only 16 tiles are required in the tileset (you could cut that number down to 6 if your tiles have symmetry)
- the tiles align with the world grid

One could also argue it's more efficient, since each tile only checks 4 neighbours as opposed to 8. But I haven't done any performance testing so no promises.

I also made a version for Unity which you can find [here](https://github.com/jess-hammer/dual-grid-tilemap-system-unity)

See Oskar St√•lberg's original proposition of a dual-grid system: https://x.com/OskSta/status/1448248658865049605

Just like Oskar...I don't understand why the dual-grid method isn't more popular!

Dual-grid system is also mentioned in ThinMatrix's video, 
which is what inspired me in the first place: https://youtu.be/buKQjkad2I0?si=9xot1uUw3PvNWvT9&t=234
